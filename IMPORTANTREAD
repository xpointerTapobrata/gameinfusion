Thank you for visiting my website. Before you visit my GameInfusion website there are few important things to keep in mind.

The website requests content from three APIs. During development all three APIs were working correctly, but after production two APIs, ie PandaScore API and Gamespot API has
stopped working. Upon inspection I found out that it was due to the CORS policy where cross domain information are blocked due to security reasons. While the PandaScore API
is working correctly upon installing a CORS unblocker, the Gamespot API still doesn't seem to work. Upon asking the community I came to the conclusion that they have not set
the headers to allow api requests on their server. Therefore, in order to have a complete look of how my website works in development mode please
click on the video in my portfolio website that shows the complete functionality of the website. However, if you want to experience the website yourself I request you to
install the 'Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin' extension from -

'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en' and the turn it on (it remains switched off by default).

I know its very inconvinient and I'am very sorry for that but unfortunately it is the only way to view the website as of now.

One more problem is that in the Stripe JS, I found restrictions for Indian purchase and the payment was not going through due to some regulations by the
Indian government. Hence, I had to emulate the payment process instead of the actual payment procedure.

-- Thank you for your time and once again sorry for the inconvenience.
